# Responsive-Portfolio
A simple web porfolio site, using vanilla CSS media queries for styling and responsive behaviour.

## Author
Madeleine Griggs, original design by the UofT coding bootcamp.

## About this Project
this is a simple website designed to showcase a portfolio of work for web development. It was made as part of a project for the UofT coding bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of how to use media queries to make a page responsive, and general knowledge of responsive websites. The design is based on an earlier project, which you can find here:
[Basic Portfolio](https://typicu.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)

the second part of this assignment, a responsive portfolio that uses Bootstrap for the responsive behaviour, can be found here:
